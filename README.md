# Atom support for Tornado Templates

Atom support for Tornado HTML templates. Originally forked from [atom-django-templates](https://github.com/benjohnson/atom-django-templates).

## How it works?

This extension supports Emmet (as the one I copied from), this will make your Tornado templating so easy:

if you want :

- `{% if something %} {% end %}` you just hit `if` and hit `Tab` like you do while you work on Emmet.

- For variables, just hit `x` and you will get `{{ }}`

- For expressions, just make `expr` and you will get `{% %}`

- For other syntaxes, you just hit the word you want, for example `extends` and you will get `{% extends "" %}` .


Thanks for the original guy who made this extension, that made me love Atom and made it as my favorite Editor.
